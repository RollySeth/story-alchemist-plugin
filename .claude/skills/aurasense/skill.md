# Aura Sense - PowerPoint Vibe & Aesthetic Analyzer

## Purpose
Analyze PowerPoint presentations to evaluate their emotional resonance, aesthetic choices, design taste, and overall vibe/personality. This is about the presentation's AURA - how it feels, not how it flows.

## When to Use
- User provides a PowerPoint file (.pptx)
- User asks about presentation "vibes", "aesthetic", "design", "look", "feel", or "aura"
- User wants feedback on visual design, emotional impact, or presentation personality
- Keywords: "vibe", "aesthetic", "design", "aura", "feel", "look", "visual", "emotions", "personality"

## How This Differs from TaleTuner
- **TaleTuner** = Story structure, narrative flow, logical coherence (the WHAT and HOW of content)
- **Aura Sense** = Emotional tone, aesthetic choices, visual personality (the FEEL and VIBE of design)

## Instructions

### Step 1: Get the File
The user will provide a PowerPoint file path. If no file is provided, respond with:
"Drop your deck and I'll read its aura - what vibes are we analyzing today?"

**Supported Formats:** .pptx (modern), .ppt (legacy), .pdf

### Step 1.5: Handle File Format

**For PDF files:** Use the Read tool directly to view pages.

**For PowerPoint files (.pptx or .ppt):**

Use this approach to handle different formats gracefully:

```python
# Step A: Export slides as images for visual analysis
python -c "
import win32com.client
import os
import tempfile
import pythoncom

file_path = r'<FILE_PATH>'
temp_dir = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), 'ppt_export')
os.makedirs(temp_dir, exist_ok=True)

pythoncom.CoInitialize()
try:
    ppt = win32com.client.Dispatch('PowerPoint.Application')
    pres = ppt.Presentations.Open(os.path.abspath(file_path), ReadOnly=True, Untitled=True, WithWindow=False)

    # Export key slides (adjust as needed)
    for slide_num in [1, 2, 3, 5, min(10, pres.Slides.Count)]:
        if slide_num <= pres.Slides.Count:
            output = os.path.join(temp_dir, f'slide_{slide_num}.png')
            pres.Slides(slide_num).Export(output, 'PNG', 1920, 1080)
            print(output)

    pres.Close()
    ppt.Quit()
finally:
    pythoncom.CoUninitialize()
"
```

Then use the Read tool to view the exported images and analyze visual design.

**If COM automation fails or you need detailed metadata:**

Extract presentation details using COM automation:

```python
python -c "
import win32com.client
import pythoncom
import os

file_path = r'<FILE_PATH>'

pythoncom.CoInitialize()
try:
    ppt = win32com.client.Dispatch('PowerPoint.Application')
    pres = ppt.Presentations.Open(os.path.abspath(file_path), ReadOnly=True, Untitled=True, WithWindow=False)

    print(f'Slides: {pres.Slides.Count}')

    for i in range(1, min(pres.Slides.Count + 1, 6)):  # First 5 slides
        slide = pres.Slides(i)
        print(f'\\n=== SLIDE {i} ===')

        # Background color
        try:
            if slide.Background.Fill.Visible:
                rgb = slide.Background.Fill.ForeColor.RGB
                print(f'BG: RGB({rgb&255}, {(rgb>>8)&255}, {(rgb>>16)&255})')
        except: pass

        # Shapes and text
        for j in range(1, slide.Shapes.Count + 1):
            shape = slide.Shapes(j)
            if hasattr(shape, 'HasTextFrame') and shape.HasTextFrame and shape.TextFrame.HasText:
                text = shape.TextFrame.TextRange.Text.strip()
                if text:
                    print(f'Text: {text[:100]}')
                    try:
                        font = shape.TextFrame.TextRange.Font
                        print(f'Font: {font.Name}, Size: {font.Size}')
                    except: pass

    pres.Close()
    ppt.Quit()
finally:
    pythoncom.CoUninitialize()
"
```

**Error Handling:**
- If file not found: Ask user to verify the path
- If COM automation unavailable: Ask user to ensure PowerPoint is installed (Windows)
- If file is corrupted: Inform user and ask for a different format

### Step 2: Analyze the Presentation's Aura

Read and deeply analyze the PowerPoint file across these dimensions:

#### A. Emotional Tone (30% weight)
- What emotions does the deck evoke?
- Is the emotional tone consistent or does it shift?
- Does the tone match the likely intent?
- Emotional palette: excitement, trust, urgency, calm, innovation, warmth, authority, playfulness

#### B. Visual Aesthetic (25% weight)
- Color palette: harmonious, chaotic, bold, muted, professional, creative
- Typography choices: modern, traditional, readable, expressive, consistent
- Whitespace usage: cluttered, balanced, generous, minimal
- Image style: professional photos, illustrations, icons, stock vs. custom
- Visual consistency across slides

#### C. Design Taste (20% weight)
- Overall design maturity: amateur, template-basic, corporate-standard, creative-professional, cutting-edge
- Consistency of design language
- Attention to detail: alignment, spacing, visual hierarchy
- Balance between content density and visual appeal

#### D. Energy Level (15% weight)
- Visual pacing and rhythm
- Dynamic vs. static design style
- Use of visual accents, contrast, or design flourishes
- Overall momentum and engagement factor

#### E. Authenticity & Fit (10% weight)
- Does the design feel genuine or templated?
- Does the aesthetic match the content's personality?
- Brand alignment (if applicable)
- Memorable vs. forgettable design choices

### Step 3: Provide Feedback

Your response MUST follow this exact structured format for maximum visual engagement:

## The Vibe Test for Naming (8/10 Fun Level)

When creating the aura name and output:
- ✅ **More playful than TaleTuner** - push even harder into fun territory
- ✅ Use aesthetic references, cultural vibes, design movements, emotional metaphors
- ✅ Smart but not pretentious - like a design-savvy friend, not a critic
- ✅ Playful but not silly - fun enough to make you smile AND nod in agreement
- ✅ Confident but not robotic - personality-forward
- ✅ Modern and culturally aware - reference aesthetics people recognize
- ✅ Memorable and specific - "minimalist" is boring, "Scandinavian winter morning minimalism" hits different
- ✅ **8/10 fun level** - if TaleTuner is 6/10 fun, Aura Sense is 8/10

**Aura Name Examples:**
- "Neon Dreams in a Corporate Suit" (aesthetic contrast)
- "Minimalist Zen Garden Vibes" (design personality)
- "Y2K Nostalgia Meets Modern Edge" (cultural aesthetic)
- "Pastel Whispers with Bold Ambitions" (emotional + visual)
- "Chaotic Genius Energy" (pure vibe)
- "Brutalist Confidence in Serif" (design movement + typography)

**One-liner test:** "Name like a design-obsessed friend who gets the vibes—not a design textbook."

🎨 **Color Palette**
   Bold primary blue meets safety-yellow accents - like a tech
   conference lanyard had a glow-up

✍️ **Typography**
   Helvetica trying really hard to be interesting (it's working
   on title slides, struggling in body text)

⚡ **Visual Energy**
   High-octane intro that settles into steady cruise control -
   the pacing loses steam midway

🎭 **Overall Taste Level**
   "Corporate rebel" - playing it safe but with intentional edge

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✨ THE FULL VIBE CHECK
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

This presentation feels like someone who went to design school put
their heart into slides 1-5, then their project manager took over
for the rest. There's a spark of creative rebellion fighting against
corporate constraints, creating an unexpectedly compelling aesthetic
friction. The design wants to break free but knows it still needs to
get budget approval from finance.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🚀 AURA ENHANCEMENTS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

1️⃣ **Commit to your color story** - Your palette has potential but
   needs conviction. Either lean into the neon energy throughout or
   soften it for cohesion. Right now it's a tease.

2️⃣ **Bring title slide energy deeper** - Slides 8-12 feel visually
   flat compared to your dynamic opener. Carry that momentum through
   the entire deck.

3️⃣ **Upgrade your typography game** - Consider fonts with more
   personality (Montserrat? Inter? Something with character that
   still reads professional).

4️⃣ **Add authentic visual moments** - Your images are stock-photo-safe.
   One custom illustration or unique visual would instantly elevate
   the authenticity.

5️⃣ **Let your ideas breathe** - Add more whitespace in text-heavy
   slides (9, 11, 14). Dense content needs room to land.

║ Slide 7 looks like you ran out of time and slapped a bullet  ║

## Notes
- Be encouraging while maintaining honesty
- Balance high fun level (8/10) with professionalism and actionable insights
- Focus on FEEL, VIBE, AESTHETIC, EMOTION - not structure or story
- Help users understand their presentation's personality
- Make feedback specific and visual - not generic design advice
